# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: 
A parameter is located in parentheses after the function and is a variable placeholder. The argument is what the actual data that gets passed back to the function when called on. 

Researched answer: The purpose of a parameter is to act as a placeholder for the expected values that either a function or method (I missed this part) will receive when called. An argument is the data that either a function or method actually operates on. 

2. What is the difference between an object and a class? 

Your answer:
An object is the end result of a class and a class is used to create the object. It is essentialy the blueprint for it. 

Researched answer: 
A class is the blueprint which defines a type and the object is an instance of that type created from that class. 

3. What is iteration?

Your answer:
An interation allows whatever it is your creating to call upon it and be executed repeatedly.

Researched answer:
An iteration allows developers to write efficient and accurate code for tasks that involve repetitive operations or processing. 

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer:
Hoisting in JavaScript allows declarations to be executed before the execution of the actual code. This allows the use of variables and functions before they are declared in the source code. Only the declaration can be hoisted, nto the initialization. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: Is a JavaScript object that stores data relevant to a component. The state allows a component to keep track of changes over time and to re-render when the state is updated. It represents the dynamic nature of a component, as opposed to props, which are immutable and passed down from parent to child components.

2. React Props: React properties are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. Props are a mechanism for communication between components, allowing the parent to pass dynamic information to its children. Props are immutable, meaning that a child component cannot modify the values it receives via props.

3. JSX: Is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React for describing what the UI should look like. JSX allows you to write HTML elements and components in a syntax that looks similar to XML or HTML, but it's essentially a syntactic sugar for function calls and object creation.
